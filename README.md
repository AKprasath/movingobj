# movingobj# Moving Object Detection using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and tracking moving objects in a video stream using computer vision techniques. The goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately identify and track objects in real-time or from pre-recorded videos.

## Features
- Object detection: Detecting moving objects in a video stream.
- Object tracking: Tracking the detected objects across frames.
- Real-time and offline processing: Support for both real-time and offline processing modes.
- Multiple object detection: Ability to detect and track multiple objects simultaneously.
- Performance optimization: Implementations optimized for speed and efficiency.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV: The core computer vision library used for image and video processing.
- Python (>=3.x): The programming language used for implementing the algorithms.
- NumPy: Used for numerical computations.
- (Optional) TensorFlow or PyTorch: For advanced object detection models (e
